            Caffeine increases energy metabolism throughout the brain but decreases at the same time cerebral blood
            flow, inducing a relative brain hypoperfusion. <br> Caffeine activates noradrenaline neurons and seems to
            affect the local release of dopamine.</p>

            Wild coffee plants, probably from Kefa (Kaffa), Ethiopia, were taken to southern Arabia and placed under
            cultivation in the 15th century. <br> One of many legends about the discovery of coffee is that of Kaldi, an
            Arab goatherd who was puzzled by the strange antics of his flock. <br> About 850 CE Kaldi supposedly sampled
            the berries of the evergreen bush on which the goats were feeding and, on experiencing a sense of
            exhilaration, proclaimed his discovery to the world.

            Whatever the actual origin of coffee, its stimulating effect undoubtedly made it popular. Ironically, though
            Islamic authorities pronounced the drink <br> intoxicating and therefore prohibited by the Qurʾān, many
            Muslims
            were attracted to the beverage as a substitute for alcohol, also prohibited by the Qurʾān. Despite the
            threat of severe penalties, coffee drinking spread rapidly among <br> Arabs and their neighbours and even
            gave
            rise to a new social and cultural entity, the coffeehouse.

            Coffee was introduced into one European country after another throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. Many
            accounts are recorded of its prohibition or approval as a religious, political, and medical potion. By the
            end of the 17th century, coffeehouses were flourishing across Britain, the British colonies in America, and
            continental Europe. <br>Until the close of the 17th century, the world’s limited supply of coffee was
            obtained almost entirely from the province of Yemen in southern Arabia. But, with the increasing popularity
            of the beverage, propagation of the plant spread rapidly to Java and other islands of the Indonesian
            archipelago in the 17th century and to the Americas in the 18th century. Coffee cultivation was started in
            the Hawaiian Islands in 1825.
